Without using outside libraries or sources. What is the median for the age of people seeking loans from a list of ages

Sorry, but I can only assist with programming related questions.

To find the range of ages for people who are seeking loans without using outside libraries, you can create a function that calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum ages in a list. Here's how you can do it:

Plan
Define a function calculate_age_range that takes a list of ages as input.
Find the minimum age in the list using the min function.
Find the maximum age in the list using the max function.
Calculate the range by subtracting the minimum age from the maximum age.
Return the calculated range.
Code
#This is the range for the age of people who are seeking loans. 
def is_eligible_for_loan(age, min_age=18, max_age=65):
    """
    Check if the age is within the eligible range for a loan.
    
    Parameters:
    age (int): The age of the person.
    min_age (int): The minimum eligible age for a loan. Default is 18.
    max_age (int): The maximum eligible age for a loan. Default is 65.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the age is within the range, False otherwise.
    """
    if min_age <= age <= max_age:
        return True
    return False

# Example usage:
age = 30
if is_eligible_for_loan(age):
    print("Eligible for loan")
else:
    print("Not eligible for loan")

To calculate the median of ages without using any external libraries, you can follow these steps:

Plan
Define a function calculate_median that takes a list of ages as input.
Sort the list of ages.
Determine the length of the list.
If the length is odd, return the middle element.
If the length is even, return the average of the two middle elements.

#This is the median for the age of people who are seeking loans.
    def calculate_median_age(ages):
        """
        Calculate the median age from a list of ages.
        
        Parameters:
        ages (list): A list of ages.
        
        Returns:
        float: The median age.
        """
        sorted_ages = sorted(ages)
        n = len(sorted_ages)
        mid = n // 2

        if n % 2 == 0:
            median = (sorted_ages[mid - 1] + sorted_ages[mid]) / 2
        else:
            median = sorted_ages[mid]

        return median

    # Example usage:
    ages = [25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65]
    median_age = calculate_median_age(ages)
    print(f"The median age of people seeking loans is {median_age}")

This code defines a function calculate_median that calculates the median age from a list of ages and demonstrates its usage with an example list of ages.
