# Assignment-2
A.) The purpose of the program was to find the range and median age of people seeking loans. 

B.) The input would be the ages of the people. It takes the inputs and compares the age to see if they're older than 18 or younger than 65. If the age fits within this range it returns the value as true. If not it returns the value as false. If the value is returned as true. It prints "Eligible for a loan" if not. It prints "Not eligible for a loan." These strings are the outputs for the range of the age of people seeking loans.
The median age input would be the list of ages of a group of people seeking loans. It takes the ages median by just dividing it by two to find the middle of the group of numbers. Then it asks if its equal to zero then. The sorted ages is subtracted by one then added to the sorted ages and divided by two to find the median. Otherwise if it's not equal to zero then the median is equal to the sorted ages. Then the output is printed as "The median age for people seeking loans is (whatever the median age is)."

C.)You use the program for the range by entering your age and it compares it in a range to determine whether you are elibible for a loan or not. So. you type your age and it outputs either "Eligible for a loan" meaning you can aquire a loan, or "Not eligible for a loan" meaning, you can't aquire a loan. Meanwhile, to use the median age of the program. You'd enter a group of numbers, it would take these sorted ages and divides by two. Then compares this new number to see if it equals zero. If it does then it subtracts it by one and adds it to itself and divides by two again. Otherwise, it just divides the sorted ages by two to find the median. So all you entire is the list of numbers and it should output, "The median age of people seeking loans is (the median number calculated)."
